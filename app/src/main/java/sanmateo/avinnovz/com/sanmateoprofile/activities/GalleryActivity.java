Upon driving through the arch above General Luna Highwaymarking the entry point to San Mateo, a marker can be seen by the side of the road saying something like you are now leaving the National Capital Region!  \\\\n\\\\nGeneral Luna Highway is San Mateoâ€™s main thoroughfare. It must be a historic road where Andres Bonifacio could have passed by on his way to Pamitinan Cave. The legendary General Licerio Geronimo and his band of tiradores could have marched this road on their way to the victorious Battle of San Mateo.");
